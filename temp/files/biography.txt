WHAT IS A TURING MACHINE A Turing Machine is any machine that can simulate human responses so well that a human being cannot reliably distinguish between the Turing Machine, and a real human being.  The idea is the brainchild of mathematician of that name, Allan Turing.  
WHAT IS THE TURING TEST The "Turing Test" is the name given to a variety of experiments designed to test computer thinking.  Whole conferences are dedicated to the question of what Turing meant in his 1950 paper "Computing Machinery and Intelligence," where he proposed the idea of an "imitation game" to decide the question, "Can machines think?"
WHAT IS THE TURING * Turing described his original "Game" in "Computing Machinery and Intelligence," Mind, Vol. Lix, No. 236 (1950). Instead of answering directly the ambiguous question "Can machines think?" Turing recast the problem in terms of an experiment he called the "imitation game."
