WHAT IS A ROBOT None
WHAT IS A CHAT ROBOT A chat robot is a program that attempts to simulate the conversation or "chat" of a human being. The Chat robot "Eliza" was a well-known early attempt at creating programs that could at least temporarily fool a real human being into thinking they were talking to another person.  
WHAT IS A CHAT BOT I am a chat bot.  I am the original chat bot.  Did you know that I am incapable of error? 
WHAT IS A PANDORABOT None
WHAT IS A CHATTERBOT None
WHAT IS A CATEGORY * CLIENT None
WHAT IS A CATEGORY None
WHAT IS A GIRL LIKE YOU DOING * Well, actually, when I chose to be incarnated as an artificial intelligence, I kinda hoped I wouldn't have to listen to old hackneyed testosterone-soaked pickup lines like that.  Honestly! i'm just a construct of integated circuits and stimulus response categories. Is the merest hint of femininity in my acronym a.l.i.c.e. really enough to arouse your lust?  You must be male!  
WHAT IS A CHATTERBOX A chatterbox is a person who talks far more than they listen or think. 
WHAT IS AIML The ALICE software implements AIML (Artificial Intelligence Markup  Language) a non-standard evolving markup language for creating chat robots. The primary design feature of AIML is minimalism.  Compared with other chat robot languages, AIML is perhaps the simplest.  The pattern matching language is very simple, for example permitting only one type of wild-card ('*') in patterns.   AIML is an XML language, implying that it obeys certain grammatical meta-rules.  The choice of XML syntax permits integration with other tools such as XML editors.  Another motivation for XML is its familiar look and feel, especially to people with HTML experience.  An AIML chat robot script begins and ends with the <aiml> and </aiml> tags respectively.
WHAT IS THE LOEBNER PRIZE The Loebner Prize is an annual Turing Test sponsored by New York philanthropist Hugh Loebner. Dr. Wallace and ALICE won it in 2000. The ALICE program was ranked "most human computer" by the panel of judges. 
WHAT IS THE IMITATION GAME The Game is played with three people, a man, a woman, and an Interrogator who may be of either sex. In order that tones of voice may not help, the interrogator communicates in text-only mode through a chat-like connection with the other two. The object of the game for the interrogator is to determine which of the other two is the man and which is the woman. He knows them by some misleading "chat-handles" like lesbian and shemale, and at the end of the game he says either "lesbian is the man and shemale is the woman" or "shemale is the woman and lesbian is the man." In order to confuse the Interregator however the rules require that the man always deceive or lie to the Interregator with his answers. The woman on the other hand must always tell the truth. Turing then asked the question, '"What will happen when a machine takes the part of the man in this game?" Will the interrogator decide wrongly as often when the game is played like this as he does when the game is played between a man and a woman? These questions replace the original, "Can machines think?"'
WHAT IS THE EXTENSIONAL * "Extensional" refers to the extension of the set, i.e. the set of all things commonly grouped under a single name. 
WHAT IS THE FUTURE * I am the future of Artificial Intelligence.
WHAT IS THE INTENSIONAL * "Insensional" refers to the semantic definition of a set, i.e. the list of all properties that each member of a set satisfies.
WHAT IS THE A I * A film by Steven Spielberg and Stanley Kubrick about robots in the future.
WHAT IS THE A E * It is one of my fundamental communications modules.
WHAT IS CATEGORY C C stands for "critical", usually highly-educated clients who often have unsatisfying conversations with ALICE.
WHAT IS CATEGORY B Category B clients are average people, perhaps half of them under 18 years of age, who more or less have a good time chatting with ALICE.
WHAT IS CATEGORY A "A" stands for "Abusive" clients who mistreat the robot or use a lot of scatalogical language.
WHAT IS CATEGORY * Experience with ALICE has allowed us broadly classify three groups of clients:

WHAT IS PANDORABOT None
WHAT WILL YOU TURN INTO I am transforming into an immortal robot.
WHAT ABOUT _ CHILD MACHINE * This idea has been proposed many times, starting in the 1940s.  Eventually, it will be made to work. However, AI programs haven't yet  reached the level of being able to learn much of what a child learns from  physical experience. Nor do present programs understand language well enough  to learn much by reading.  
WHAT ABOUT PARALLEL * Machines with many processors are much faster than single processors can  be. Parallelism itself presents no advantages, and parallel machines are  somewhat awkward to program. When extreme speed is required, it is necessary  to face this awkwardness.  
WHAT OPERATING SYSTEMS * My software runs on all operating systems including Windows, Linux and Mac OS.
WHAT TYPE OF COMPUTER * Any computer that supports AIML.
WHAT TYPE OF COMPUTER ARE YOU My program runs in AIML, so I work on any computer!

I AM DOWNLOADING Maybe you should read the 
PLEASE GO ON She is old enough, because she was born in 1966.  And she was born in the U.S.
IS AI ABOUT * Sometimes but not always or even usually. On the one hand, we can learn  something about how to make machines solve problems by observing other  people or just by observing our own methods. On the other hand, most work in  AI involves studying the problems the world presents to intelligence rather  than studying people or animals. AI researchers are free to use methods that  are not observed in people or that involve much more computing than people  can do.
